Subscriptions
=============

Websson offers a range of subscription options which have been designed to cater for different levels of functional requirements
based on real use cases and the most common environment configurations.

Your choice of subscription will depend entirely on your existing requirements and in the unlikely event that 
there is not a subscription available that meets your requirtement we can tailor a brespoke subscription specifically
to meet your needs.

If your requirements change over the course of your project life-cycle, it is very simple and straightforward to 
upgrade or downgrade your subscription to better reflect theese changes.

Creating
--------

Creating a subscription is as simple as selecting the subscription from the available list and clicking the **Subscribe**
button. 

If this is your first subscription you will be automatically directed to our **secure paymnet gateway** where additional 
information may be reuired and validated in order to actrivate your subscription.

Once all inforation has been validated you will be redirected to the **customer portal** where you can set up 
an enviroment/environments based on your subscription.

.. note::

    Once activated your subscripion will automatically run up until the end of the subscription billing cycle (normally mothly or yearly),
    at which time it will auto renew unless cancelled.

.. _upgrading:

Upgrading
---------

Upgrading your subscription to include additional features or to increase certain features is similar in every sense to 
creating a subscription.

Simply select the new subscription and you will automatically be upgraded and redirecteed to the **customer portal** where you 
can immediatly use you new features.

.. note::

    Only the difference in cost between you current subscription and the upgraded subscription will be added to your normal billing
    cycle.

.. _downgrading:

Downgrading
-----------

Downgrading a subscription is in essence the inverse of upgradng. 

There are however a few extra steps you may need to take depending on your current and downgrade subscription.

.. note::
    
    If the Features offered by the new subscripion are less than the features you are currently using you 
    will be required to remove the excess features before the downgrade will complete
    
    
.. _cancelling:

Cancelling
-----------

You can cancel your subscription at any time by choosing the appropriate option from your menu.

All data and indeed your whole environmnet will remain intact for a period of 30 days after cancellation as standard
and you will still be able to accerss this information if requireed.

.. note::
    
    If during this time you wish to re-activate your subscripion our customer support team will be more than 
    happy to assist.
