Environments
============

By default once you have successfully activated your :doc:`subscriptions` you are ready to create an environment/environmnets
based on your subscription features.

This includes but is not limited to the number of environments, disk space, ram, domain names, database engines and ide's/editors
offered in the selected subsctipion.

If your subscription offers multiple environments, the above are cumulative across all environments and with a few exceptions
will distribute your subscription feature totals across all environments.
